This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has an unusual file structure or configuration.  It's not a common error, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without more context. The error message itself is often vague, providing little information about the source of the problem. Possible reasons include incorrect dependencies, conflicting configurations within the `app.json` or `package.json` files, problems with native modules, and more. The error might manifest during the build process, start-up, or while interacting with specific Expo APIs.
